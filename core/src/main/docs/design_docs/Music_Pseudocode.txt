// This has the design for which song to play and when

Songs are arranged into folders indicating moods.

Currently the moods are:
Calm, Agitation, Conflict, Impasse, Cliffhanger, Climax, and
End of Battle (good or bad)

There is a special folder called UI, which are UI tracks:
- Title Screen
- Stage Intro: play during the narrated story / tutorial
before the stage starts
- Town Management: if we ever get to that

Mood shift logic:
- Every time the mood of the game is shifted, a random song is
played from the folder of that mood.

- All battle starts at Calm. Calm lasts while the number of
active engagements on the map are from 0 to 3.

- Agitation: 3 to 10 active engagements on map.

- Conflict: a) more than 10 engagements on map. Play this for 5
minutes then automatically switch to Impasses. b) also switch
to this playlist when a command is issued that affects a large
number of troops ("large" is a constant that we tune later)

- Impasse: alternate with Conflict. Play this for 10 minutes
then return to Conflict.

- Cliff Hanger: play this during the sealing spell. Volume
slowly rising while the spell is in effect, and ebbs when the
hero is distracted. The volume rises to a maximum after the
spell is in effect for 30 seconds, and ebbs at the same rate.
After this song plays to completion, there is a 5 second long
musical silence, then back to Calm, Agitation, or Conflict
depending on the number of active engagements.

- Climax: play this after the last portal is sealed. This is
an optional event in the game if we code to that point. After
the last portal is sealed, a gigantic wave of enemy will enter
from the very top of the map in a slow, dramatic fashion.

- Battle End: there is a song for win and lose.
